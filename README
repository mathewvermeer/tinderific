Tinderific
=====================================

An old (and unfortunately unfinished) Play web application written in Scala that I made as a student hobby project many years ago. It logs into Tinder using Facebook OAuth, and provides a web interface for the Tinder smartphone app. Instead of a single person, it displays eight recommendations concurrently on the screen. It also allows the user to automatically perform any number of likes, and change location using Google Maps.

Naturally, it was compatible with an older version of Tinder and, hence, no longer functions.
